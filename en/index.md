Some of these translations include: [Việt ngữ][vi], [汉语][cn], [Español][es], [Slovenčina][sk], [日本語][ja], [Polski][pl], [Português][pt], [Русском][ru], [Bahasa Indonesia][id], [Bahasa Melayu][ms], [Українською][uk], [한국어][ko], [Italiano][it], [Deutsch][de], [বাংলা][bn], [Türkçe][tr], and [ภาษาไทย][th].
